# ExamBranchProject
This project adheres to GCET guidelines and can only be hosted on other servers without the SQL Data.
Hence alternative duplicate data is required to run it for demo purposes.
Thus prior to hosting Ip addresses and ports should be configured before build and so forth.
Server folder corresponds to the nodejs files 
while the "exambranchproject" folder holds the reactjs files
